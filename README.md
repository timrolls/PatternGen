# PatternGen
 svg Pattern generator

 Loads a folder of SVGs and randomly arranges them on a grid, recoloring based on weighted color palette. 

 Press space to create a new layout/iteration.
 S to save out PDF and PNG. 

 Colors are listed in colors.txt in hex values, followed by weighting (ie. how many multiples of that choice show up in the list)
 
 Geometry is pulled from the .svg files in the data folder. For consistency sake it helps if those are the same size. Closed shapes required for color fill. Random coloring will respect groups, so either ungroup or group as necessary for the effect you want.
